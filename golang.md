In the projects, in which I work, it comes up that I am asked what I recommend for xyz. So that I don't forget half of the information, I'll started to collect it thematically and in a more or less structured way and publish it here.
Here my hopefully helpful ressoures for the Go language.

There is always the danger that with time compact functions become real "monsters" that are hard to read or understand. one of my last experiences was a function where the indented code was only visible, without scrolling, on the last 20% of the monitor (49" Samsung CRG 9) on the right side.
Not my code, should help to debug, will we need a 49" monitor for debugging or two of them side by side in future? A healthy balance would suit us all.
- [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) This page collects common comments made during reviews of Go code, so that a single detailed explanation can be referred to by shorthands.
