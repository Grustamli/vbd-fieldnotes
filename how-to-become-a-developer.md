_Don't underestimate the cursive marked lines_: a developer is a problem solver, who develops solutions to solve own or others problems, not only a coder!

Some general notes:
- Take time, learn, take notes. Get experience by doing projects. Practice and experience, is important. Improve have fun.
- If you are critised don't take it personal!
- If you criticise don't get personal!
- Bloom's Taxonomy: Remember - Understand - Do / Apply - Analyze - Evaluate - Create
- Iterative approach, communication, getting feedback, giving feedback and common sense. That's my 5 cent.
