# Acronyms, terms and concepts

The world of software developers is full of abbreviations and strange terms. This list should be a summary of the terms I have encountered so far. Some with my own explanation others with a link to further information. I hope the list helps you. Please link to the document, it may be that the document structure can change fundamentally over time.
Before you can understand a technical term, you must at least have read or heard it before so that you can look it up.

- Stakeholdermanagement, stakeholders are the ones who can influence the project the most from the outside (e.g. money). Get in good with them and understand their needs so that the project keeps going and you don't get kicked. Note to myself: stop using steakholder management as a gag - it's not funny
