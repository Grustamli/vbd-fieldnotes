# Acronyms, terms and concepts

The world of software developers is full of abbreviations and strange terms. This list should be a summary of the terms I have encountered so far. Some with my own explanation others with a link to further information. I hope the list helps you. Please link to the document, it may be that the document structure can change fundamentally over time.
Before you can understand a technical term, you must at least have read or heard it before so that you can look it up.
