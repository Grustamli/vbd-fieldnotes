# AI

For several years, in my spare time and without earning any money, I have been working on a system for answering support requests. The system was able to analyze incoming messages and provided text suggestions for answering them, which could have been sent as an e-mail. Unfortunately, the system never went live and was also very focused on domain-specific knowledge due to the training material available. I think chatgpt is the first step. However, I am not yet sure in which direction.
