# Fieldnotes
Public repository of my field notes from 25+ years as computer guy.

I'll start with the latest notes and slowly work my way back to the old topics. These will mainly be notes, snippets, tools and some til's. Since recently I publish in [public-log](https://github.com/vbd/Fieldnotes/tree/main/public-log) my weekly summary of read articles, lessons learned etc. May they be helpful for someone.
Possibly also anonymized anecdotes so that there is something to laugh about.

There are no source codes created by me, because they are mostly created in the context of customer projects or projects with nda. Therefore a publication is not or only very limited possible.
