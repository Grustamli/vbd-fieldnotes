# Fieldnotes
Public repository of my field notes from 25+ years as computer guy.

I'll start with the latest notes and slowly work my way back to the more exciting topics. These will mainly be snippets, tools and some til's.
Possibly also anonymized anecdotes so that there is something to laugh about.
