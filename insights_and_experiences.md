# Insights and experiences of > 25 years being a dev

This document, like the entire repo, is work in progress.

I will share some experiences and resources that might be helpful for starting developers, nerds, like me, tech savy users and everyone interested. Language specific topics can be found in the named accordingly repo files.

I'll try to add 1-2 sections a week depending on my health in this file.

I nowadays mostly develop with Python and Golang. I tried Rust but a third language is currently to much for me. So I will stick with Python and Golang.

The focus of my development projects were and are:
- bring different -glue- applications and platforms together (data exchange, data import, data export, etc.)
- tooling for (small) big data, up to 5 TB
- CRUD web applications
- cli tools and text user interface tools
- automation scripts
- mostly backend, frontend only if I couldn't avoid or couldn't hand over to someone else. I'm not good in making shiny, fancy web frontends

> Being a dev is not being a code monkey! A dev creates solutions to solve problems and to get things done in a more convenient way!

TODO:
## Some "easy" insights
## Finding and fixing bugs / technical debt
## Getting into new codesbases
## idea: Automation
## Focus, flow and context switching
## idea: "Green" software
## Softskills
## Being criticized and criticizing
## Scrum, Agile, Watrefall, Kanban, ... or how I got my projects really done
## Personal resilience and health and why I failed at it
## Why freelancer a very personal view
## Self-organization, not in the meaning of Scrum
## idea: productivity, efficiency, effectiveness and self-optimization 10x devs etc.
## idea: how to become "agile", why a certificate doesn't make you "agile" and why sometimes a certificate may be necessary
## idea: In the face of AI: the future of software development (imho) more problem solving, solution-oriented and critical thinking, less code writing and hard, for many of us, more soft skills
