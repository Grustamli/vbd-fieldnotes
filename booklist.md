On a regular base I have to deal with Python, some Golang and since March
2023 starting Rust. As a developer I normally solve problems and/or
develop products/services. That means I have to deal in different extend
with product management, project management, agile, self organisation,
soft skills etc. Here are my personal recommendations recommendations.


> **HINT**: Learning x in e.g. 3 days / 2 weeks / x month is bullshit.  
> I do software development for more than 25 years and get everyday a "today I learned"-moment.
> Reading books books alone will not make you a software developer
>
> The links lead mostly to amazon -> I don't use any affiliate link.  
> You can buy your books where you want and surely you will do.  
> I recommend if you buy the books, think about supporting your local book store! 

I own all the books. Some as ebook, some in print, some in German language, some in English language.
I've read them all!

Books that have had a lasting influence on my way of thinking and approaching things.
I wished some of them would have been published earlier. Others have confirmed, reinforced and deepened my experience.
Although I have been doing this for more than 25 years, I still read books to stay up to date and learn new things. However, I have not been following every trend for a long time.

> **NOTES**: 

- I've read a lot book dealing with scrum. But I've to admit none of them convinced me that much and that's why i stayed with the scrum guide. So no special recommendation.
- Make notes of what you read and learned.
- Write your notes in a simple language in a way that you would explain the topic to someone in an explain like I'm five style.
- Use technical terms when appropriate.
- Your customer wants solutions - normally he is not interested in the programming language and tools you use.
