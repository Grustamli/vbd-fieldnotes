- [What's up, Python? The GIL removed, a new compiler, optparse deprecated...](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/whats-up-python-the-gil-removed-a)

- [Jetzt bewiesen: GitHub Copilot stiehlt Code // deutsch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM__OqpYJl4) :arrow_right: why am I not surprised anymore training data for the sake. The issue of licenses/open source is getting really exciting. If Copilot just reproduces code, the programmers might be violating licenses without knowing it. That's maybe fine for individual learning, but never with real code, because the tools also upload code. As a freelancer, I am now always contractually prohibited from using AI for commercial projects.
