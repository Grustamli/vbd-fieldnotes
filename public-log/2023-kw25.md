## Tools

## Reminder, refresher and TIls of the week

### Python vs Golang vs Rust

Focus for language decision, also main focus must be something else as
being a developer. I love developing but the environment for projects becomes
more and more hostile.

- Python
    - (+) Prototyping
    - (+) Libraries
    - (+) Machine Learning / Data Science
    - (-) Distribution
- Golang
    - (+) easy language
    - (+) concurrency
    - (+) single file distribution
- Rust for the big rest
    - (+) As far as I learned for frontend and backend no need for JS. [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/)
    - (+) helpful compiler messages
    - (-) complex language
    - (-) problematic politics

I think I will invest more in Rust, keep up Python and Golang, I like it
but note sure... I need room in my head for other topics that get me
hooked.
