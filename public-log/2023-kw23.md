## Tools

## Reminder, refresher and TIls of the week

Before writing python functions check if use of [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv), [miller](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller), [awk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/) is possible.
- these tools could often increase performance
- could reduce development time
- sometimes easier for deploy
- use the tool(s) and let python[^1] do the rest

If [ff](https://github.com/genotrance/ff) as wrapper for fzf is not available something like may work `fd -e md | fzf | xargs vim`

[^1]: or any other language
