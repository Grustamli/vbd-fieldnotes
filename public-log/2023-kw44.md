## Reminder, refresher and TIls of the week

found the shortcut <kbd>WIN</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> for [Windows 11 snap feature](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241) so I can retire some of my third party apps. Thank you Microsoft!   
But I sure will investigate [dwm-win32](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/dwm-win32) further.
