Unfortunately, I didn't understand and appreciate it at the time. I was too young, too inexperienced, too naive, too stupid. Only as the years went by did I begin to understand what he did with pencil and paper and I always wondered why he didn't use the terminal. I, on the other hand, have always thrown myself straight onto the keyboard for many years. Thank you Hartwig. And for some DEC VAX experiences and a lot more, thank you Jochen.

## My wins of the week

Found [Numbat](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat) a great tool
which replaced already and will replace some more of my self-written Python 2+3 scripts and some of my self-written Golang programs.
"Numbat is a statically typed programming language for scientific computations with first class support for physical dimensions and units."
I will use it as cli calculator for a lot of time calculations and conversions and probably things I haven't even thought of yet.
